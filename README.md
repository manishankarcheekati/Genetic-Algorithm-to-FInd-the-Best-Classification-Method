# Genetic-Algorithm-to-FInd-the-Best-Classification-Method-for-Titanic-Dataset
This Algorithm helps us to find the better classification method for a given Dataset

Basically Every Classification Problem has many classifiers.

People Generally gets confused to find the best classifier

Genetic Algorithm gives a way to find the best Classifier for your Dataset and gives you the parameters upon which we need to use to our model
